Adds unlockable early-game crafting recipes for the small glow ring and small magnet ring.

I have been playing mostly on Steam Deck since 1.6 released and the one downside is how dark and impossible it is to see at night time in game without a glow ring.

### How to obtain recipes:

-   Small Glow Ring - Combat Level 1
-   Small Magnet Ring - Mining Level 1

Since both skills should be achievable very early on, the crafting ingredients are relatively simple and should also be obtainable by the time you level up.

### Compatibilities

This mod would likely go really well with [Ring Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10669), as that wonderful mod adds upgrade recipes for both rings once you reach Mining Level 4.

Since this mod only requires [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) and doesn't change the way the rings work, it shouldn't have any incompatibilities.
