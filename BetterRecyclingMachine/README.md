# Better Recycling Machine

Use the Recycling Machine for more than just trash. Recycle artifacts, fertilizers and soils, fences, signs, sprinklers, and more!

This mod is heavily inspired by one of my favourite SDV 1.5 mods: [Recyclable Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13331) by [Zilchaz](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/zilchaz/about-me).

Better Recycling Machine was written from scratch to work entirely, and solely with, Content Patcher for 1.6.

## What You Can Recycle:

    Artifacts
    Fertilizers and Soils
    Sprinklers (disabled by default)
    Fences and Gates (disabled by default)
    Signs (disabled by default)
    Torches

All categories can be toggled on and off in the config.

Works with [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063)!

### What You Get Back:

Most items have a few logical resources they will convert into in the Recycling Machine, and often the amount of that resource received will vary slightly each time to keep some amount of randomness and luck to it. For instance, recycling a gold mask will return 3-5 gold ore and recycling a wooden statue could get you wood or possibly hardwood. My hope is that variable returns will make gameplay a little more interesting.

### Compatibilities

Works with [Visit Mount Vapius](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9600), which adds its own custom artifacts, and those artifacts are all recyclable because Lumisteria helpfully used similar context tags as vanilla artifacts.

Other mods that use context tags for their custom items should also work without any direct compatibility needing to be added as I used context tags instead of item ids to hopefully increase modded item compatibility.
