#### Works by default with the Vanilla farm cave map.

#### Compatibility with some modded farm cave maps has been added. Check compatibility list below. There is a "Compatibility Mode" config option that can be enabled to attempt improving general compatibility if not directly added.

This content pack adds 1 new minecart location to the vanilla farm cave, which becomes usable once you unlock the minecarts as normal. This mod should work with any farm map that uses the vanilla farm cave layout.

**Language support for:** English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, and Chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³
**Can be further localised for any language by using GMCM to enter a custom location name.**

#### Compatibilities

-   [Beach Minecart](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13650) - the beach gets added to the minecart destination list if installed.
-   [Integrated Minecarts](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11881) - highly recommended to use alongside any custom minecart mods and mods that add additional minecarts (Ridgeside, East Scarp, SVE) as it integrates all minecart networks into one single destination list and allows you to re-order the destination list.
-	[Hot Spring Farm Cave](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5849) - if Hot Spring Farm Cave is installed, a compatibility patch should automatically apply
-	[More Lively Farm Cave](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/23190) - if More Lively Farm Cave is installed, a compatibility patch should automatically apply
-	[Additional Farm Cave](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/14109) - if Additional Farm Cave is installed, a compatibility patch should automatically apply
-	An additional compatibility patch should also automatically apply if Additional Farm Cave is present with Hot Springs Farm Cave or More Lively Farm Cave

#### Credits

I took motivation from [Integrated Minecarts](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11881) to try creating a new minecart location. So huge props to [Jibblestein](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/5639823) for creating a very cool mod. Huge thanks to [Pathoschild](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/1552317) for making CP docs so easy to understand.
