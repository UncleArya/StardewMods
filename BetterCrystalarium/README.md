# Better Crystalarium

#### Process more items in the Crystalarium in a balanced way, such as Prismatic Shards, Mystery Boxes, Artifact Troves, and more!

All items that can be processed in the Crystalarium have been balanced using an approximate rate of 120g/day (same as vanilla minerals) to duplicate an item. This results in very long processing times for rare and valuable items such as Prismatic Shards and Pearls.

Only requires [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915).
