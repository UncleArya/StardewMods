Purchase level 1 baby Resource Chickens from Marnie once you have a Coop constructed. Resource Chickens cost twice as much as vanilla chickens because they can be twice as helpful. Resource eggs can be converted into resources, turned into mayo, and used in cooking recipes.

Level 2 and above chickens produce eggs that provide higher tier resources but can only be obtained through gameplay.

Each subsequent increase in chicken level adds 10% to both the sell price of eggs and sell price of chickens!

<summary>Spoiler: Help Obtaining a Fiber Chicken</summary>

Once you have reached **Forage skill level 2**, the following will have a chance to spawn:

-   A rare drop from breaking weeds in the [Cindersap Forest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cindersap_Forest) that contain a fiber chicken egg
-   A rare drop from breaking weeds in the [Railroad](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Railroad) that contain a fiber chicken egg
-   A fiber chicken egg in the [Secret Woods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods)
-   Each map location will each have a **maximum of 1** fiber chicken egg spawn per day
-   If a forage spawn has occurred in that map that day, it will reset and go away at the end of each day

<summary>Spoiler: How to Find and Process Geode Eggs</summary>

Once you have reached **Mining skill level 3**, a custom geode egg mining node will have a rare chance to spawn in the Mines containing a geode chicken egg. The geode egg node can also spawn in the Quarry.

Geode chicken eggs, when placed in the Resource Egg Converter will randomly produce the following:

-   A geode once any player has entered the Mines once
-   A frozen geode once any player has reached level 40 in the Mines
-   A magma geode once any player has reached level 80 in the Mines
-   An omni geode once any player has reached the bottom of the Mines

<summary>Spoiler: How Processing Bomb Eggs Works</summary>

Once you have reached **Mining skill level 4**, Bomb Eggs become obtainable.

Bomb chicken eggs, when placed in the Resource Egg Converter will randomly produce the following based on the player's current mining level:

-   Mining Level less than 6: 100% Cherry Bomb
-   Mining Level less than 8: 60% Cherry Bomb, 40% Bomb
-   Mining Level greater than 8: 50% Cherry Bomb, 33% Bomb, 17% Mega Bomb

_Bombs and Mega Bombs are only available at higher mining levels to align with when their crafting recipes becoming available to attempt keeping them as balanced as possible._

<br/>**Craft (or purchase) a Resource Egg Converter**  
The crafting recipe for the Resource Egg Converter is unlocked once reaching Farming skill level 2. Marnie will also start selling the Resource Egg Converter at that time as well. Once a resource egg is put into the machine, it takes 3 hours for them to be turned into a resource. (Production time can be adjusted in the configs).

Resource eggs can be put into a Resource Egg Converter to produce their respective resource, or, if you already have plenty of that resource available, put the special resource eggs into the vanilla Mayonnaise Maker to produce mayo (large resource eggs also produce gold quality mayo like vanilla eggs!) To expand on your chicken empire, resource eggs can also be put into the Incubator in the Big Coop or Deluxe Coop to make more Resource Chickens. Short on regular eggs for a cooking recipe? Resource eggs can also be used in cooking recipes as a substitute for regular eggs.

To help make room on your farm for all your new chickens, a 3rd upgrade to the Coop is now available to build from Robin. The Giant Coop can house up to 24 Coop animals and also comes with a second Egg Incubator with the building upgrade. The second incubator that comes with the Giant Coop upgrade can be picked up by hitting it with an axe or pickaxe and then placed anywhere else in the coop (must be placed in the coop to hatch chickens).

The larger Coop map gives you lots of space for your machines and chests. The building sprite was also made by the lovely [Tophatta](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/54445652)!

**Note: if multiple incubators are ready to hatch chickens in the same coop, you must leave and re-enter the coop after naming each chicken. The game only allows for naming and spawning 1 chicken at a time. After naming the first chicken, simply exit and re-enter the coop to receive the prompt to name the next chicken.**

Resource Chickens can start producing large resource eggs once you reach a 2 heart relationship with them (configurable), which can be turned into slightly more resources.  
<br/>Works with [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063)!  
<br/>Also works with the Auto Grabber!

Feel like aspects of Resource Chickens are overpowered or underpowered? There are many difficulty and balancing settings to customise your playthrough. Either change directly in the config.json or by using [GMCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) (recommended).  
<br/>Some of what can be customised:

-   The appearance of resource chickens (and vanilla chickens to match)
-   The sell and purchase price of Resource Chickens
-   Amount of resources you can get from your Resource Chickens
-   How quickly Resource Chickens produce eggs
-   How long it takes to incubate and hatch baby resource chickens
-   Change what tier of Coop (Coop, Big Coop, Deluxe Coop) is required before you can purchase Resource Chickens
-   And lots more!

Vanilla style sprites are edits done by Tophatta and I, of existing vanilla sprites originally made by ConcernedApe. Hatta style sprites are original creations made by [Tophatta](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/54445652).
</br>
</br>There are currently two appearance options for Resource Chickens sprites using [GMCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098). You can also select 'Both' in the config options to have chicken sprites be randomized between both styles using the 1.6 Skins feature (not all chickens have 2 styles).
</br>
</br>**Vanilla Style:** recolouring and edits done by Tophatta and I of existing vanilla sprites originally made by ConcernedApe.
