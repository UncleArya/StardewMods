<br/>**Show your chickens some love and they will reward you with special eggs that can be converted into crafting and building resources**.

#### Level 1 Chickens

-   **Clay Chicken**
-   **Coal Chicken**
-   **Stone Chicken**
-   **Wood Chicken**

#### Level 2 Chickens

-   **Bait Chicken**
-   **Copper Chicken**
-   **Fiber Chicken**
-   **Hardwood Chicken**
-   **Sap Chicken**

#### Level 3 Chickens

-   **Geode Chicken**
-   **Iron Chicken**
-   **Moss Chicken**
-   **Quartz Chicken**

#### Level 4 Chickens

-   **Coming Soon!**

Purchase level 1 baby Resource Chickens from Marnie once you have a Coop constructed. Resource Chickens cost twice as much as vanilla chickens because they can be twice as helpful. Resource eggs can be converted into resources, turned into mayo, and used in cooking recipes.

Level 2 and above chickens produce eggs that provide higher tier resources but can only be obtained through gameplay.

Each subsequent increase in chicken level adds 10% to both the sell price of eggs and sell price of chickens!

<summary>Spoiler: Help Obtaining a Fiber Chicken</summary>

Once you have reached **Forage skill level 2**, the following will have a chance to spawn:

-   A rare drop from breaking weeds in the [Cindersap Forest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cindersap_Forest) that contain a fiber chicken egg
-   A rare drop from breaking weeds in the [Railroad](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Railroad) that contain a fiber chicken egg
-   A fiber chicken egg in the [Secret Woods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods)
-   Each map location will each have a **maximum of 1** fiber chicken egg spawn per day
-   If a forage spawn has occurred in that map that day, it will reset and go away at the end of each day

_If you feel fiber chicken egg forage spots are too rare or not rare enough, please provide feedback. This is not currently something that can be user configurable, so I attempted to balance it as evenly as I thought people would want_

<summary>Spoiler: How to Find and Process Geode Eggs</summary>

Once you have reached **Mining skill level 3**, four types of custom geode stones will have a rare chance to spawn in the Mines, each containing a geode chicken egg.

Geode chicken eggs, when placed in the Resource Egg Converter will randomly produce the following:

-   A geode once any player has entered the Mines once
-   A frozen geode once any player has reached level 40 in the Mines
-   A magma geode once any player has reached level 80 in the Mines
-   An omni geode once any player has reached the bottom of the Mines

_If you feel geode chicken eggs are too rare or not rare enough, please provide feedback._

<br/>**Craft (or purchase) a Resource Egg Converter**  
The crafting recipe for the Resource Egg Converter is unlocked once reaching Farming skill level 2. Marnie will also start selling the Resource Egg Converter at that time as well. Once a resource egg is put into the machine, it takes 3 hours for them to be turned into a resource. (Production time can be adjusted in the configs).

Resource eggs can be put into a Resource Egg Converter to produce their respective resource, or, if you already have plenty of that resource available, put the special resource eggs into the vanilla Mayonnaise Maker to produce mayo (large resource eggs also produce gold quality mayo like vanilla eggs!) To expand on your chicken empire, resource eggs can also be put into the Incubator in the Big Coop or Deluxe Coop to make more Resource Chickens. Short on regular eggs for a cooking recipe? Resource eggs can also be used in cooking recipes as a substitute for regular eggs.

-   [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) - Required
-   [Item Extensions](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20357) - Required to obtain Geode and Fiber Chickens

### ![gameplay](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/6a142d2f-303b-478c-ab36-187242fbb7c5)

Resource Chickens can start producing large resource eggs once you reach a 2 heart relationship with them (configurable), which can be turned into slightly more resources.  
<br/>Works with [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063)!  
<br/>Also works with the Auto Grabber!

### ![customisability](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/e5511628-d9f7-4163-9aac-6d7b76028b0d)

Feel like aspects of Resource Chickens are overpowered or underpowered? There are many difficulty and balancing settings to customise your playthrough. Either change directly in the config.json or by using [GMCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) (recommended).  
<br/>Some of what can be customised:

-   The appearance of resource chickens (and vanilla chickens to match)
-   The sell and purchase price of Resource Chickens
-   Amount of resources you can get from your Resource Chickens
-   How quickly Resource Chickens produce eggs
-   How long it takes to incubate and hatch baby resource chickens
-   Change what tier of Coop (Coop, Big Coop, Deluxe Coop) is required before you can purchase Resource Chickens
-   And lots more!

### ![future-plans](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/1c910e82-8daf-4eaa-acfe-a54dfb07f3b1)

Here are my goals as I continue to develop and update Resource Chickens:

-   Adding new chicken breeds for additional resource types
-   Adding increasingly rare chicken eggs that must be unlocked and obtained through gameplay
-   Interesting, balanced, and fun ways to obtain end-game level resources

### ![sprite-art](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/b80fee2d-eb74-4fce-bef5-7b9051fe7751)

Some spirtes are edits done by me of existing vanilla sprites originally made by ConcernedApe, with many sprites being original creations made by [Tophatta](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/54445652).
</br>
</br>There are currently two appearance options for Resource Chickens sprites using [GMCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098):
</br>
</br>**Vanilla Style:** recolourings and edits done by me of existing vanilla sprites originally made by ConcernedApe.

</br>**Hatta Style:** custom and unique sprites created by the wonderfully talented [Tophatta](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/54445652)!

</br>You can also enable vanilla chickens to look Hatta Style
