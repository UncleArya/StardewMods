<br/>**Show your chickens some love and they will reward you with special eggs that can be converted into crafting and building resources**.

#### Level 1 Chickens

-   **Clay Chicken**
-   **Coal Chicken**
-   **Stone Chicken**
-   **Wood Chicken**

#### Level 2 Chickens

-   **Copper Chicken**
-   **Fiber Chicken**
-   **Hardwood Chicken**

#### Level 3 Chickens

-   **Coming soon!**

Purchase level 1 baby Resource Chickens from Marnie once you have a Coop constructed. Resource Chickens cost twice as much as vanilla chickens because they can be twice as helpful. Resource eggs can be converted into resources, turned into mayo, and used in cooking recipes.

Level 2 chickens produce eggs that provide higher tier resources but can only be obtained through gameplay.

<summary>Spoiler: Help Obtaining a Fiber Chicken</summary>

Once you have reached **Forage skill level 3** (or any player has if playing multiplayer), the following will have a chance to spawn:

-   A fiber chicken egg in the [Secret Woods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods)
-   An artifact dig spot in the [Cindersap Forest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cindersap_Forest) containing a fiber chicken egg
-   An artifact dig spot around the [Railroad](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Railroad) containing a fiber chicken egg
-   Each map location will only have a **maximum of 1** fiber chicken egg forage spawn per day
-   If a forage spawn has occurred in that map that day, it will reset and go away at the end of each day
-   Each map location has a **50% chance** of spawing a fiber chicken egg forage spot each day
-   There is a chance that there will be 0 fiber chicken egg forage spawn on any given day

_If you feel fiber chicken egg forage spots are too rare or not rare enough, please provide feedback. This is not currently something that can be user configurable, so I attempted to balance it as evenly as I thought people would want_

<br/>**Craft (or purchase) a Resource Egg Converter**  
The crafting recipe for the Resource Egg Converter is unlocked once reaching Farming skill level 2. Marnie will also start selling the Resource Egg Converter at that time as well. Once a resource egg is put into the machine, it takes 3 hours for them to be turned into a resource. (Production time can be adjusted in the configs).

Resource eggs can be put into a Resource Egg Converter to produce their respective resource, or, if you already have plenty of that resource available, put the special resource eggs into the vanilla Mayonnaise Maker to produce mayo (large resource eggs also produce gold quality mayo like vanilla eggs!) To expand on your chicken empire, resource eggs can also be put into the Incubator in the Big Coop or Deluxe Coop to make more Resource Chickens. Short on regular eggs for a cooking recipe? Resource eggs can also be used in cooking recipes as a substitute for regular eggs.

### ![gameplay](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/6a142d2f-303b-478c-ab36-187242fbb7c5)

Resource Chickens can start producing large resource eggs once you reach a 2 heart relationship with them (configurable), which can be turned into slightly more resources.  
<br/>Works with [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063)!  
<br/>Also works with the Auto Grabber!  
<br/>Could be a unique way to collect resources on challenge runs.

### ![customisability](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/e5511628-d9f7-4163-9aac-6d7b76028b0d)

Feel like aspects of Resource Chickens are overpowered or underpowered? Just about everything can be customised in the config settings, either directly in the config.json or by using [GMCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) (recommended).  
<br/>Some of what can be customised:

-   The appearance of resource chickens (and vanilla chickens to match)
-   Change the purchase and/or sell price of chickens
-   Change how much of each resource you can get from each chicken type
-   How long it takes to incubate and hatch baby resource chickens
-   Change the crafting recipe for machines and items that require crafting
-   Change what tier of Coop (Coop, Big Coop, Deluxe Coop) is required before you can purchase Resource Chickens
-   And lots more!

### ![future-plans](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/1c910e82-8daf-4eaa-acfe-a54dfb07f3b1)

Here are my goals as I continue to develop and update Resource Chickens:

-   Adding new chicken breeds for additional resource types
-   Adding increasingly rare chicken eggs that must be unlocked and obtained through gameplay
-   Interesting, balanced, and fun ways to obtain end-game level resources

### ![sprite-art](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/b80fee2d-eb74-4fce-bef5-7b9051fe7751)

There are currently two appearance options for Resource Chickens sprites using [GMCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098):
</br>**Vanilla Style:** recolourings and edits done by me of existing vanilla sprites originally made by ConcernedApe.
</br>**Hatta Style:** custom and unique sprites created by the wonderfully talented [Tophatta](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/54445652)!
</br>Reference images are on the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21800) and also in the mod folder.

Current languages supported: English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, Chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ (Thanks [Orville9972](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/73926958))

Want to help translate this mod into another language? This mod is fully prepared for i18n localisation. Download the default.json file in the i18n folder of this mod or reach out to me over Discord (UncleArya). I can then add your translation file to the main mod file for improved localisation support.

### ![compatibility](https://github.com/UncleArya/ResourceChickens/assets/100550741/6fd7bf0e-ffc8-4edb-82f0-9125eef99c80)

This mod relies entirely on [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915), so it should be fully compatible with pretty much every other mod out there. [Farm Type Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3231) is used to allow for mod items to spawn as forage but it does not change vanilla forage spawning.

Please let me know if you come across any issues.
