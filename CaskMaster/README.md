#### This is a simple content pack for Stardew that allows for aging far more artisan goods in the Cask using only Content Patcher.

**Fully customisable, you can place the following items in a cask to increase their quality and value over time.**

**Enabled By default:**

-   Jelly
-   Juice
-   Pickles
-   Honey
-   Truffle Oil
-   Aged Roe
-   Caviar
-   Raisins
-   Dried Fruit
-   Dried Mushrooms
-   Smoked Fish

**Disabled by default:**

-   Mayo
-   Syrups (Maple Syrup, Pine Tar, Oak Resin)
-   Coffee
-   Green Tea
-   Oil

Any other items you would like to be added into casks? Let me know!

#### Processing Times

I have attempted to balance processing time based on the average sell value of an item compared to the processing time for vanilla cask items. Please let me know if you feel the balancing is too overpowered or underpowered with any of these items.

#### Sell Prices

Item sell prices have not been adjusted and follow the vanilla cask output calculation of:

-   Silver (base x 1.25)
-   Gold (base x 1.5)
-   Iridium (base x 2)

#### Other Great Cask Mods

I had the idea to create this mod after testing [Age More Things](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12997) for compatibility with 1.6. That awesome mod still works (and I definitely recommend it if you use [Custom Casks Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2642)), but I was curious to know if I could create something similar, slightly more expansive, and user configurable with only Content Patcher with 1.6. It turns out, yes!

#### Cask Mods to use with Content Patcher

These mods would combine well with Caskmaster, and also only use Content Patcher:

-   [Casks In Buildings](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21631) - Allows for placing casks in selected buildings, like sheds, greenhouse, and barns
-   [Cask Enabled Sheds](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7678) - Allows for placing casks in sheds

Fun alternative to Caskmaster that also has a secondary file that includes the ability to age more goods in custom casks.
**_Would not be compatible with Caskmaster. Either use Upgraded Casks or Caskmaster, not both!_**

-   [Upgraded Casks](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22477)

#### Cask Mods to use with Custom Casks Mod

If you use [Custom Cask Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2642), do not use Caskmaster and instead use:

-   [Age More Things](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12997) - Allows for aging truffle oil, juice, jelly, roe, and caviar
-   [Advanced Casks Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8413) - Unlockable progressive casks that expand cask gameplay

#### Great Mods to Pair with Caskmater

-   [Machines Copy Quality](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21366) - Allows machine output to match the quality of item put into it, which would allow for faster cask processing times
-   [UI Info Suite 2](https://github.com/Annosz/UIInfoSuite2/releases) - See processing times on cask mouseover
