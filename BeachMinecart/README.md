This content pack adds 1 new minecart location at the beach, which becomes usable once you unlock the minecarts as normal. Can be optionally turned off on vanilla beach festival days. By default the new minecart is on the map for the Luau and Midnight Jellies festivals, but is not interactable due to how those festivals work. The Beach Minecart is interactable during the Night Market festival.

**Built-in language support for:** English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, Chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, and Hungarian ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º
**Can be further localised for any language by using GMCM to enter a custom location name.**

I created this because my partner kept complaining about having to run all the way to/from the beach and wished there was a minecart to get there faster.

#### Config Options

-   Map edits can be disabled on (vanilla) beach festival days
-   Custom Minecart location name (defaults to 'Beach' or translated equivalent)

#### Compatibilities

-   Works with Ridgeside, East Scarp, & Stardew Valley Expanded
-   [Farm Cave Minecart](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/14870/) - the farm cave gets added to the minecart destination list if installed.
-   [Integrated Minecarts](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11881) - highly recommended to use alongside any custom minecart mods and mods that add additional minecarts (Ridgeside, East Scarp, SVE, etc) as it integrates all minecart networks into one single destination list and allows you to re-order the destination list!

#### Credits

I took motivation from [Integrated Minecarts](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11881) to try creating a new minecart location. So huge props to [Jibblestein](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/5639823) for creating a very cool mod. Huge thanks to [Pathoschild](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/1552317) for making CP docs so easy to understand.
