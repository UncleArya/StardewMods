Adds unlockable early-game crafting recipes for the small glow ring and small magnet ring.

I have been playing mostly on Steam Deck since 1.6 released and the one downside is how dark and impossible it is to see at night time in game without a glow ring.

### How to obtain recipes:

This is a super simple mod that unlocks a crafting recipe for the Small Glow Ring after you reach Combat Level 1 and a recipe for the Small Magnet Ring after reaching Mining Level 1. Since both skills should be achievable very early on, the crafting ingredients should also be obtainable by the time you level up.

### Compatibilities

This mod would likely go really well with [Ring Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10669), as that wonderful mod adds upgrade recipes for both rings once you reach Mining Level 4.

Since this mod only requires [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) and doesn't change the way the rings work, it shouldn't have any compatibilities.
